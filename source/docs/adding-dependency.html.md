title: Adding a Dependency
---

##### Adding a Dependency

To add a dependency to our cookbook we edit the `metadata.rb` file and the runit cookbook with a `depends` statement:

~~~
name 'git_cookbook'
maintainer 'The Authors'
maintainer_email 'you@example.com'
license 'All Rights Reserved'
description 'Installs/Configures git_cookbook'
long_description 'Installs/Configures git_cookbook'
version '0.1.0'
chef_version '>= 12.1' if respond_to?(:chef_version)

depends "runit", "~> 3.0.0"
~~~

Note that we're adding a constraint on the version of the runit cookbook. While this isn't strictly required it is something you want to consider as cookbooks can introduce breaking changes in the future.

Now, let's see if we get to pass our tests:

Awesome, our tests worked for the first time and all we had to do was add one line - MAGIC. But how and where did we get this `runit` cookbook?

When we generated out cookbook earlier one of the files was a `Berksfile`, this file is used by an application called Berkshelf to resolve dependencies for Chef cookbooks. Let's look at it:

~~~
$ cat Berksfile
source 'https://supermarket.chef.io'

metadata
~~~

- `source` tells Berkshelf what endpoint to resolve dependencies against
- `metadata` tells Berkshelf to parse `metadata.rb` for dependencies

In our case, Kitchen uses Berkshelf to fetch a version of `runit` that fits the constraints we set from the Chef Supermarket and takes care of uploading the entire cookbook set to the instance. The Chef provisioner of Kitchen supports other alternatives for cookbook dependency resolution, though Berkshelf is the most commmon default.

~~~
$ kitchen list server
Instance            Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action    Last Error
server-ubuntu-1604  Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Verified       <None>
server-centos-7     Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
